                    <div style="text-align:center;">The eviction process can be a confusing, time consuming, and expensive process.  CourtZip was created to simplify this process at a reasonable price.  We have built first party tech that automates much of this process and in some courts happens in real time eliminating wasted processing time in the mail.  We can simply assist in the filings or we can take it the whole way and deliver you a vacant secured property. The level of service is your choice</div>

                    <div style="text-align:center;">You will fill out a form online asking for all relevant information(address, tenant name, delinquency amount, etc.).  The court fees are automatically calculated which vary depending on the number of defendants, location, and balance. The form is converted to a court approved document.  Next, you will pay the court costs and $25 service fee through our site.  Upon payment, the form will be filed electronically or by courier within 24 hrs.
